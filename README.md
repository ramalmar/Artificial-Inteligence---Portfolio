# My AI Project Portfolio

Welcome to my AI project portfolio! Here you can find some examples of my AI projects with links to their respective repositories.
I hope you find these projects interesting. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you would like to collaborate on an AI project. If you are interested in hiring me for an AI-related position, I am open to job opportunities as well.

## Transfer Learning Applied for Paella Image Classification.
I implemented a multi-class neural network classification, which aims to identify and categorize various typical Valencian dishes, such as paella, arroz a banda, arroz al horno, and fideu√†. It also includes a class capable of identifying paellas that do not follow the traditional recipe. Additionally, I used an Instagram bot for data scraping to download images of Valencian dishes from Instagram, which are then classified using the pre-trained model.
