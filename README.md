Projects


## Paella images classificator
I implemented a multi-class neural network classification, which aims to identify and categorize various typical Valencian dishes, such as paella, arroz a banda, arroz al horno, and fideu√†. It also includes a class capable of identifying paellas that do not follow the traditional recipe
